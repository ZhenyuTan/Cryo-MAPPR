# Cryo-MAPPR
Cryo-EM micrograph automated particle picking routine

## Goal
The goal of this project is to fullly automate particle picking through empirical determination of 'good' parameters for particle picking. This will entail shape based picking (DoG picking) and then later reference-based picking.
