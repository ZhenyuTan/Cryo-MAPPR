# Cryo-MAPPR
Cryo-EM micrograph assessment and particle picking routine

## Goal
The goal of this project is to fullly automate micrograph assessment and particle picking through empirical determination of 'good' parameters for particle picking. This will entail shape based picking (DoG picking) and then later reference-based picking.
